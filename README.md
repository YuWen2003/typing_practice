# typing_practice
Simple timed typing practice: 
letters from a to z will appear randomly on the screen. The user inputs from the keyboard, as long as there is input on the keyboard, the letter will disappear and the next letter will appear, and if the input is wrong, it will record how many times the key was wrong. The user needs to achieve the correct elimination of 20 letters (not consecutive) to pass the level.
